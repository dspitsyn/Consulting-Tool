  | This is a terrible way to live life. DBAs and Developers have had the 5% and 30% rule for index
  | maintenance pounded into their heads for so long that they donâ€™t know any better. No one really
  | measures performance before and after, nor do they take into account the time and resources
  | taken to perform the maintenance against any gains that may have occurred.
  | For thresholds, we usually recommend 50% to reorganize, 80% to rebuild, and for larger databases, only tables with a page count > 5000.
  | Make sure that CommandLog table exists in msdb database.
